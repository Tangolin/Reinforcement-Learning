### Description
--- 

This is a pytorch implementation of the REINFORCE algorithm in reinforcement learning.

Trained on Openai Gym Cartpole V0.

Guarantees convergence but I did not keep track of the number of episodes required to do so.

**main.py** - main .py file to run the algorithm  
**train.py** - implements the training algorithm  
**model.py** - model used for the agent, in this case a simple neural network  

If you do find any issues with the code, please do contact me to discuss :)
